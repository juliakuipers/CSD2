//tick calculation 
//modulator caculation (without any audio signal)
//modulator * frequency + fundemental frequency 
//both modulator and carrier are oscillators
//maybe make a function fm in oscillator where the modulator gets calculated, so i can implement it on every waveform in the oscillator. then freq += fundemental * modulator   
//oscillator has an fm function (serum)
